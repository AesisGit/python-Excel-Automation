## Install Prerequisites (Ubuntu Linux)

```
sudo apt install python pip python-opencv python-xlrd python-gtk2-dev
```

## Install Prerequisites (Windows 10)

Install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Add the location of python.exe to your PATH environment variable

Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it in command prompt:

```
python get-pip.py
```

Add the location of pip.exe to your PATH environment variable

Run this in a command prompt

```
pip install pypiwin32
pip install xlrd
pip install openpyxl
```

Download the latest OpenCV whl (wheel) file from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) then install it like this:

```
pip install opencv_python-3.2.0-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl
```

Might need [Visual C++ 2015 redistributable (vc_redist.x86.exe)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) for OpenCV

If you need GTK, follow [this guide](https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php)
